# Waze
Waze is a case study in the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate course

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to develop a machine learning model to predict monthly user churn for the Waze app. By analyzing user data, the project aimed to identify factors
contributing to user churn and provide insights to help Waze prevent churn and improve user retention. The final model achieved an accuracy of 80%, providing Waze with valuable insights
into user behavior and preferences.

## Business Understanding

Waze seeks to increase growth and retention by preventing user churn, which quantifies the number of users who uninstall or stop using the app. High retention rates indicate satisfied
users who contribute to the app's success over time. Developing a churn prediction model allows Waze to proactively engage at-risk users and implement strategies to retain them. Insights
from the model will help Waze optimize retention strategies, enhance user experience, and make informed decisions about product development.

## Data Understanding

The analysis utilized user data collected by Waze, including user interactions, engagement metrics, and demographic information. The dataset covered a specific timeframe to capture
monthly user churn rates. Exploratory data analysis revealed patterns and trends in user behavior, helping to identify potential predictors of churn. Data limitations may include biases
in user reporting and missing or incomplete data, requiring careful preprocessing and validation to ensure model accuracy.

## Modeling and Evaluation

Various machine learning models, such as logistic regression and decision trees, were trained and evaluated to predict monthly user churn. Evaluation metrics, including accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1-score, were used to assess model performance. The final model achieved an accuracy of 80%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting user churn. Feature
importance analysis identified key factors influencing churn, providing actionable insights for Waze to implement targeted retention strategies.

## Conclusion

The predictive model developed in this project offers Waze valuable insights into user churn behavior and preferences. By accurately predicting monthly churn rates, Waze can proactively
engage at-risk users and implement strategies to improve retention. Recommendations include ongoing monitoring and refinement of the model, as well as collaboration with cross-functional
teams to implement retention initiatives. Future steps may involve incorporating additional data sources and conducting longitudinal analyses to track user behavior over time.
